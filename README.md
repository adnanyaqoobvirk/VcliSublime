## VcliSublime
Vertica Sublime plugin with smart autocompletion based on PgcliSublime

## Installation and Configuration
Clone this repository in Sublime Text 3 packages directory.

You need vcli and vertica_python with python 3 support which I have implemeted in my vcli and vertica_python forks so you can install them in virtual environment using pip and then most of the configuration is same as PgcliSublime.
